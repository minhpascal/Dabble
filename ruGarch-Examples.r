##Filtering
# Sometimes it is desirable to simply filter a set of data with a predefined set of parameters. This
# may for example be the case when new data has arrived and one might not wish to re-fit. The
# ugarchfilter method does exactly that, taking a uGARCHspec object with fixed parameters.
# Setting fixed or starting parameters on the GARCH spec object may be done either through
# the ugarchspec function when it is called (via the fixed.pars and start.pars arguments to the
# function), else by using the setfixed<- and setstart<- method on the spec object. The
# example which follows explains how:

## Forecasting and the GARCH Bootstrap
#There are 2 types of forecasts available with the package. A rolling method, whereby consecutive
#1-ahead forecasts are created based on the out.sample option set in the fitting routine, and an
#unconditional method for n>1 ahead forecasts. It is also possible to combine the 2 creating a
#rather complicated object. Additionally, it is possible to estimate the forecast density by means
#of the ugarchboot method which implements the strategy described in Pascual, Romo and Ruiz
#(2006). This method also includes the option to include parameter uncertainty via a monte
#carlo method. An example illustrates together with Figure 3 created using the plot command
#on the resulting uGARCHboot object:

 spec = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "eGARCH", garchOrder = c(1,
 1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1), arfima = FALSE),
 distribution.model = "std")
 fit = ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = sp500ret, out.sample = 0,
 solver = "solnp", solver.control = list(trace = 0))
 bootpred = ugarchboot(fit, method = "Partial", n.ahead = 120,
 n.bootpred = 2000)

 distribution.model = "std")
 fit = ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = ret[,1], out.sample = 0,
 solver = "solnp", solver.control = list(trace = 0))
 bootpred = ugarchboot(fit, method = "Partial", n.ahead = 120,

## Rolling Estimation
# The ugarchroll method allows to perform a rolling estimation and forecasting of a model/dataset
# combination, optionally returning the VaR at specified levels. More importantly, it returns the
# distributional forecast parameters necessary to calculate any required measure on the forecasted
# density. The following example illustrates the use of the method where use is also made of the
# parallel option and run on 10 cores. Figure 4 is generated by calling the plot function on the
# returned uGARCHroll object. Additional methods, and more importantly extractor functions
# can be found in the documentation.

## Simulated Parameter Distribution and RMSE
# It is sometimes instructive to be able to investigate the underlying density of the estimated
# parameters under different models. The ugarchdistribution method performs a monte carlo
# experiment by simulating and fitting a model multiple times and for different ’window’ sizes.
# This allows to obtain some insight on the consistency of the parameter estimates as the data
# window increases by looking at the rate of decrease of the Root Mean Squared Error and whether
# we have N consistency. This is a computationally expensive exercise and as such should only
# be undertaken in the presence of ample computing power and RAM. As in other functions,
# parallel functionality is enabled if available. The example which follows illustrates an instance
# of this test on one model and one set of parameters. 

# Simulation may give answer to:
# Q: How much data should I use to model GARCH processes with confidence?
# The distribution of the parameters varies by model, and is left to the reader to consult relevant
# literature on this. However, using 100 data points to try and fit a model is unlikely to be a sound
# approach as you are unlikely to get very efficient parameter estimates. The rugarch package
# does provide a method (ugarchdistribution) for simulating from a pre-specified model, data
# of different sizes, fitting the model to the data, and inferring the distribution of the parameters
# as well as the RMSE rate of change as the data length increases. This is a very computationally
# expensive way to examine the distribution of the parameters (but the only way in the non-
# Bayesian world), and as such should be used with care and in the presence of ample computing
# power.
